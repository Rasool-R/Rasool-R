# Hi, I'm Rasool Rajabi 👋  
### Machine Learning Engineer in Progress | Data Science Enthusiast

I am a Machine Learning enthusiast with around one year of hands-on experience in machine learning algorithms and data analysis.  
My focus is on building structured, end-to-end Machine Learning systems with clean code and practical impact.

Alongside classical ML, I am actively strengthening my Deep Learning knowledge and experimenting with neural network architectures for real-world tasks and working with data stored in relational databases using SQL.
